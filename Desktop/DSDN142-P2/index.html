<h3>FURTHER RESEARCH</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>INTERACTION GOAL</h5>
    <p>The goal of this interaction is to take a dog for a walk whilst maintaining control over it. This interaction is less methodical than others, as it involves many unpredicible factors that cannot be anticipated. </p>
    <h5>ELEMENTS INVOLVED</h5>
    <p>The elements involved in this interaction is the owner, the dog, its collar and other external factors such as environment.   The steps involving this interaction is physically interacting with the dog, and controlling it's unpredictable actions. </p>
    <h5>INFLUENCES</h5>
    <p>Whilst observing this interaction there were many different influences that caused the dog to initally pull at the collar. One of them was an external factor of a bird nearby causing the dog to shift in movement.</p>
    <h5>FINDINGS</h5>
    <p>The unpredictable nature depending on many factors including the type of dog could be considered problematic in this interaction. Further research found that this type of unpredictablity in some cases caused further stress and anxiety from both the owner in controlling the dog and the dog itself.
